## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a Sales Analysis project, which focuses on the analysis of key sales performance metrics. The primary objectives of this project are to analyze and gain insights into the Average Order Value (AOV), Monthly Sales Growth, and Sales Conversion Rate of a business.

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of this Sales Analysis project are as follows:

- **Average Order Value (AOV) Analysis:** To calculate and analyze the Average Order Value over a specified time period, providing insights into the average revenue generated per customer order.

- **Monthly Sales Growth Analysis:** To track and analyze the monthly sales growth over time, helping to identify trends and seasonality in sales performance.

- **Sales Conversion Rate Analysis:** To determine and assess the sales conversion rate, which measures the effectiveness of turning leads or visitors into paying customers.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Data Sets:** I have worked with various datasets, ranging from sales data and marketing analytics to financial information and demographic data.

- **Interactive Visualizations:** The Power BI reports included are interactive, allowing users to explore the data and discover insights on their own.

- **Data Transformation:** I have applied data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure that the data is accurate and ready for analysis.

- **Insightful Reports:** Each report is designed to tell a story and present key findings and recommendations.
